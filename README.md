# Jokes on Me

I have been tasked with performing research on employees. I have 6 CSVs to aid me with my research. 

To carry out this task, I created tables in SQL and imported the CSVs into the tables. I then used queries to answer the questions I was asked.

Upon completion of these tasks, I realized something fishy was going on.
To do further analysis, I used Pandas to read the database into Python. 
Using MatPlotLib, I created an histogram and a bar graph.

Based on the bar graph, I knew the data I was given was no good. The relative average salaries of the various positions makes no sense. 

Finally, I looked up my own employee ID - 499942. My name was listed as April Foolsday.
