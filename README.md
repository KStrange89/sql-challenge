# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I have been tasked with performing research on employees. I have 6 CSVs to aid me with my research. 

To carry out this task, I had to create tables in SQL, import the CSVs into the tables, and answer some questions.

Upon completion of these tasks, I realized something fishy was going on.
To do further analysis, I read the database into python using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas. 
Using MatPlotLib, I created an histogram and a bar graph. 
Next, I looked up employee 499942. This employee's name was April Foolsday.
